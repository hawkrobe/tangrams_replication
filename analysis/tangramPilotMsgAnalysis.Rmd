This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Import pilot Message file
```{r}
tangramMsg <- read.csv('tangramPilotMsg.csv')
```

```{r explorMsg}
str(tangramMsg)
head(tangramMsg)
summary(tangramMsg)
```

```{r wordCount}
wordcount <- function(str) {
  sapply(gregexpr("\\b\\W+\\b", str, perl=TRUE), function(x) sum(x>0) ) + 1 
}
```

```{r wordcount2}
wordcount2 <- function(str) {
sapply(gregexpr("\\W+", str1), length) + 1
}
```
