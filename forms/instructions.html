	<p> In this experiment, we'll be playing a communication
	game. The game has two roles, which will be assigned
	randomly. Since you will not know which role you will play
	until the game starts, you will be responsible for
	understanding the responsibilities and goals of both
	roles.  </p>

	  <p> If you are the first person to arrive in a game, you must wait
	shortly for another player to join. Once both players have
	joined the game, you will see a display like the
	following: </p>

	</p> -->

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/tangram_board.png" alt="Example gameplay" style="width:600px;height:320px"></center>
	</p>




	<!-- <p> On the right side of the screen, labeled "Play-space", you
	will see a grid filled with various objects. On the left side
	of the screen, labeled "Chatbox", you will see a chat window
	that you can use to communicate with the other player. </p> -->

	<p> On the upper half of the screen, labeled "Chatbox", you will see a chat window that you can use to communicate with other players.  On the bottom half of the screen, labeled "Play-space", is a game board filled with different tangram pictures.

	<p> Both the "matcher" and "director" have the same number and type of tangrams on their board but the tangrams are randomly shuffled. The goal of this task is for the "matcher" to organize the tangrams on their board just like the tangrams are ordered on the "director's" board. </p>
			
	<h3> Director instructions </h3>


	<p> If you are the "director", you need to give the "matcher" clear instructions on where to move their tangrams to match the positions of your tangrams. For example, at the start of the game your board could be like the one on top and the "matcher's" board could be the one on the bottom. </p>

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/matcherStart1.png" alt="initial director's board'" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
	</p>	

	<p>
	  <center><img src="images/matcherStart2.png" alt="initial matcher's board" style="width:600px;height:200px"></center>
	</p>	

	<p> By the end of the game, the tangrams on the "matcher's" board should be arranged exactly like the tangrams on the "director's" board. 

	<h3> Matcher instructions </h3>

	<p> If you are the "matcher", you will need to follow the "director's" instructions as best as you can. This means you will click and drag on your tangrams to move them where the "director" tells you to. You are free to send messages to the "director" to clarify or ask for instructions. To move your tangrams, you simply need to click and drag on the desired tangram. A red highlighted box will appear around the box your tangram will be dropped in. 

	When you and the director think your boards are matching please click the submit board button located in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

	</p>

	<h4> Keep in mind </h4>

	<ol>
		<li> There will be a total of SIX ROUNDS. At the start of each round, the "matcher's" and "director's" boards will be  randomly shuffled and the chatboxes will be cleared. The currentround number is printed on the right side of the screen. </li>
	  <li> During each round, please talk only about the game. Try not to talk about the objects except as needed to move them around the grid. We will be recording the messages you send for research purposes. </li>
	   <li> Lastly, a score will be displayed on your screen telling you about how many tangrams you correctly matched in the previous round. Good luck!
	</ol>
