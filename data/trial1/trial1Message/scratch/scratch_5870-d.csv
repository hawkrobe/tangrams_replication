//from John who emailed me...he said that he and his teammate went through each round but at the end of it he got an error saying the HIT wouldn't submit. 

Error said  "You have exceeded the maximum allowed page request rate for this website."

He said "I am running Win 7 64bit with Chrome."

Could have something to do with running too many scripts
